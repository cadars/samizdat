Publish [a single HTML file](https://cadars.github.io/samizdat) (and an RSS feed) with Jekyll and Github Pages.

- Choose “Use this template” and enable Github Pages in the project settings
- Edit the publication details in `_config.yml`
- Write in Markdown in the `_posts` and `_pages` folders
- You might also be able to use your own domain name but I haven‘t gone that far
