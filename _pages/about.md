What is this?
:  **Samizdat** is a template for publishing with Github's default static site generator, Jekyll. It produces <a href="#" download="index">a single HTML file</a> out of Markdown documents, and an elegant PDF when printed.

How to use it?
:  On [Github](https://github.com/cadars/samizdat), choose “Use this template”, enable Github Pages in the project settings, edit the publication details in `_config.yml`, and write in the `_posts` and `_pages` folders.

How to change the layout, colors…
:  The default theme has some general CSS variables available, or start from scratch by including only `base.css`.
