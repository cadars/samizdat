What is this?
:  A template to publish with Github's default static site generator, Jekyll. It produces <a href="#" download="index">a single HTML file</a> out of Markdown documents, and an elegant [PDF](index.pdf) when printed.

How do I use it?
:  [Go there](https://github.com/cadars/samizdat) and choose “Use this template”, enable Github Pages in your project settings, edit the publication details in `_config.yml`, and write in the `_posts` and `_pages` folders.

How to change the layout, colors…
:  The default theme has some CSS variables available, or you could start from scratch by including only `base.css`.
